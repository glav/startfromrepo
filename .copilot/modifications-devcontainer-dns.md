# DevContainer DNS Resolution Fix

## Problem
The devcontainer was failing to build whenever features were added, with DNS resolution errors for `deb.debian.org` and other hostnames during the feature installation phase.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by using the `image` property directly with devcontainer features. When features need to install packages (like the git feature), they create intermediate build layers that need network access. In WSL environments with certain network configurations, these intermediate layers couldn't resolve DNS properly.

## Solution
Switched from using the direct `image` property to using the existing `Dockerfile` that was already present in the `.devcontainer` directory.

### Changes Made to `devcontainer.json`:

1. **Switched to Dockerfile-based build:**
   - Changed from `"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0"` to `"dockerFile": "Dockerfile"`
   - The Dockerfile already contains all necessary tools including git, zsh, curl, wget, etc.

2. **Removed redundant features:**
   - Commented out the git feature since git is already installed in the Dockerfile
   - This eliminates the need for feature installation that was causing DNS issues

3. **Enabled remoteUser:**
   - Uncommented `"remoteUser": "vscode"` to use the non-root user defined in the Dockerfile

4. **Removed DNS workaround:**
   - Removed the `runArgs` with DNS settings since they're no longer needed with the Dockerfile approach

## Why This Works
- The Dockerfile builds with normal Docker DNS resolution (which works fine in your environment)
- Features are not needed since the Dockerfile already installs all required tools
- The build happens in a single stage without intermediate feature installation layers
- Other devcontainers work because they likely use Dockerfiles or don't use features that require package installation

## Benefits
- ✅ Resolves DNS issues during feature installation
- ✅ Uses existing Dockerfile that was already configured
- ✅ Includes additional tools (dotnet global tools, zsh configuration)
- ✅ Uses non-root user for better security
- ✅ Faster build times (no feature installation overhead)

## To Add More Features
If you need to add more features in the future, consider:
1. Adding them directly to the Dockerfile instead of using devcontainer features
2. Or, keep features that don't require network access (like simple configurations)

## Testing
Rebuild the devcontainer to verify:
1. Command Palette → "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
2. The build should complete without DNS errors
3. Git and other tools should be available in the container
