# Plan: GitOrigin

## Phase 1: Test Design
- Task 1.1: Create tests for changing git origin functionality
- Task 1.2: Set up test environment and mock git commands

## Phase 2: Implementation
- Task 2.1: Add new method to GitCliUtility for changing git remote origin
- Task 2.2: Update the CloneRepositoryAsync method to call the new method
- Task 2.3: Modify Program.cs to handle any errors from the process
- Task 2.4: Add functionality to rename the default branch to 'main'

## Phase 3: Validation
- Task 3.1: Test the implementation with a real repository
- Task 3.2: Verify that git push works with the new origin
- Task 3.3: Test the branch renaming functionality

## Checklist
- [x] Task 1.1: Create tests for changing git origin functionality
- [x] Task 1.2: Set up test environment and mock git commands
- [x] Task 2.1: Add new method to GitCliUtility for changing git remote origin
- [x] Task 2.2: Update the CloneRepositoryAsync method to call the new method
- [x] Task 2.3: Modify Program.cs to handle any errors from the process
- [x] Task 2.4: Add functionality to rename the default branch to 'main'
- [x] Task 3.1: Test the implementation with a real repository
- [x] Task 3.2: Verify that git push works with the new origin
- [x] Task 3.3: Test the branch renaming functionality

## Success Criteria
- After cloning the repository, the git remote origin should point to the new destination repository
- The default branch in the repository should be named 'main'
- A git push command from the cloned directory should try to push to the destination repository using the 'main' branch
- The application should handle and report any errors in the process
- All tests should pass successfully
